This is a basic implementation of an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system utilising Swift. 

The system displays a list of all current patients, in which users can access patient details and prescribe medications. In the main screen, users can also 
add new patients which can be similarly modified.

NOTE: The dynamically updating implementation of the application is only accessible through preview. Upon launching the app- the dynamic updates are not 
yet implemented likely due to environmental changes. 

Thank you!
